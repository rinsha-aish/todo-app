![ToDoApp](https://github.com/rinsha-aish/ZestyBeanzProject-Rinsha/assets/116577884/55629c50-42e2-42c1-9e1c-9b02f59b2a3f)

A simple Todo List application built using React. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, deleting, updating, and marking tasks as completed.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
